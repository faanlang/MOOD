# MOOD

Multi-Objective-Optimization-Design project

Project in which multi-objective-optimization is used to help with the design of biological circuits.
Circuits are first modelled as ODE's with the tellurium library and then solved using a evolutionary algorithm. 
Original idea by Boada e.a. (2016), of which the matlab files are included. Python implementation is new.
